## Dewey Decimal System Training Software
This software is designed to help novice librarians learn about the Dewey Decimal System in a fun and engaging way. It consists of three main tasks: replacing books on their shelves, identifying broad areas a book belongs to, and finding the call number for a specific topic.

## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you on how to install and run the application.

### Prerequisites

### Using the Software
Upon launching the application, you can choose between three tasks: replacing books, identifying areas, and finding call numbers.

- For "Replacing Books", the application generates 10 random call numbers. Your task is to reorder these numbers in ascending order. If you get the ordering right, you earn points!
- For "Identifying Areas", you'll be presented with a match-the-columns question. You need to match the call number (top level only) with its description. Each correct match earns you points!
- For "Finding Call Numbers", a quiz will guide you through the Dewey Decimal hierarchy until you find the correct answer. Each correct answer earns you points!
